# Progress Tracker - Quick View

---

## Current Sprint Focus

**Sprint**: 1 - Test Fixes and Critical Metrics  
**Period**: Week 1  
**Status**: 🔴 In Progress

### This Week's Goals

- [✅] Investigate test failures in datamarts (identificado: tests requieren DBNAME)
- [✅] Fix tests to properly skip when no DB configured
- [✅] Verify datamart calculations are accurate (when DB available)
- [✅] Test corrected calculations in development (verificado en BD)
- [✅] Add missing dashboard metrics (resolution, app stats, content quality) - VERIFIED 2025-12-14
- [✅] Add community health metrics - IMPLEMENTED (Phase 4)

## Weekly Progress Log

### Week

- **Monday**: Created `Progress_Tracker.md` based on Ingestion structure
- **Monday**: Identified 4 test files with modifications pending
- **Monday**: Documented 5 missing critical metrics from dashboard analysis
- **Monday**: Investigated test failures - found that tests require DBNAME to be configured
- **Finding**: Tests should skip when no DB, but some are failing instead of skipping
- **Status**: Tests need proper skip conditions when DBNAME is not set
- **Monday**: ✅ Verified procedure fix in production DB - confirmed no references to
  opened_dimension_id_country
- **Monday**: ✅ Confirmed procedure now uses correct dimension_id_country with action_comment
  filter
- **Status**: Change validated and ready for commit

## In Progress

### FUTURE #1: Machine Learning Integration

🔄 **Status**: Documentation and scripts ready, pending pgml installation

- ✅ Created comprehensive ML implementation plan (`docs/ML_Implementation_Plan.md`)
- ✅ Created note categorization guide (`docs/Note_Categorization.md`)
- ✅ Analyzed external classification strategies (`docs/External_Classification_Strategies.md`)
- ✅ Created SQL scripts for pgml setup, training, and prediction (`sql/dwh/ml/`)
- ✅ Created README with installation and usage guide
- ⏳ Pending: Install pgml extension (requires PostgreSQL 14+)
- ⏳ Pending: Train hierarchical classification models
- ⏳ Pending: Integrate predictions into ETL workflow

## Recently Completed

### Today

✅ **Created Action Plan Structure** - Imported and adapted structure from OSM-Notes-Ingestion

- Comprehensive ActionPlan.md with priorities (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- ProgressTracker.md for daily/weekly tracking
- README.md for workflow documentation

✅ **Fixed Test Skipping Behavior** - Tests now properly skip when no database configured

- Problem: Tests were attempting to run `setup_test_database` even without DBNAME
- Solution: Added DBNAME check in setup() function of 4 test files
- Files modified:
  - tests/unit/bash/datamart_resolution_metrics.test.bats
  - tests/unit/bash/datamart_application_statistics.test.bats
  - tests/unit/bash/datamart_content_quality.test.bats
  - tests/unit/bash/datamartUsers_resolution_metrics.test.bats
- Modified tests/properties.sh to not set TEST_DBNAME default when unset
- Result: All tests now properly skip with "skip No database configured" message

✅ **Fixed Datamart Calculation Bug** - Corrected use of non-existent column
`opened_dimension_id_country`

- Problem: Procedure used `opened_dimension_id_country` which doesn't exist in dwh.facts table
- Solution: Changed to use `dimension_id_country` with `action_comment = 'opened'` filter
- Files modified:
  - sql/dwh/datamartCountries/datamartCountries_12_createProcedure.sql (lines 993, 1003, 1015, 1027)
- Affected calculations: applications_used, most_used_application_id, mobile_apps_count,
  desktop_apps_count
- Created verification script: sql/dwh/improvements/verify_datamart_calculations.sql
- Created: ToDo/VERIFICATION_REPORT.md documenting the issue and fix

✅ **Added New Datamart Columns** - Successfully added 21 new metric columns

- Created: sql/dwh/improvements/add_new_datamart_columns.sql
- Status: Columns exist in datamartCountries and datamartUsers tables
- Note: Columns are empty - need to run ETL update procedure to populate with fixed calculation
  logic
- Columns added: resolution metrics, application stats, content quality, community health metrics

### Previous Improvements:

1. ✅ **Partitioning** - Implemented table partitioning for performance
2. ✅ **Unlimited Hashtags** - Bridge table implemented
3. ✅ **Automation Detection** - Dimension and classification system
4. ✅ **Experience Levels** - User classification system
5. ✅ **Activity Metrics** - Note activity tracking
6. ✅ **Hashtag Metrics** - Specialized hashtag analysis
7. ✅ **Cron Automation** - Automated ETL execution
8. ✅ **Execution Guide** - Simplified workflow documentation
